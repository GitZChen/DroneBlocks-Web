# DroneBlocks-Web
Control small drones in a drag and drop programming interface.  

Our diverse team of educators, programmers, and pilots use unique and exciting strategies to teach students the ins and outs of drone operations.  This technology will be an integral part of the future of these young adults and we are eager to spark a passion and drive to develop new and creative ways to use drones to do good things locally, nationally and globally.
